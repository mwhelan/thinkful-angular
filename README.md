# Thinkful Learn AngularJS

In July 2014, I participated in the Learn AngularJS course from [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com). In this course you learn to build Angular applications using a project-based curriculum designed by a member of Googleâ€™s core Angular team. 

What you learn:

- Single page application design
- Animations
- Test driven development
- Build best practices with Gulp, Bower and Node

The projects were:

1. Mad Libs - The famous word game. You are prompted to supply keywords of your choosing, which are then plugged into a silly story. This app shows Angular data binding, modules, controllers, scope, forms, and animations. 
2. Waitstaff Calculator - A tool that helps wait staff at restaurants compute meal costs and track their tips over the course of a shift. Shows Angular data binding, forms, routing, and animations.
3. Instagram Searcher - A tool that allows users to search Instagram for pictures. Demonstrates templates, modules, controllers, scope, animations and JSON API calls with the Instagram API.
4. Countries and Capitals - An Angular app that allows users to search and visualize data about countries and capital cities. Demonstrates routes, services, animations, promises, and JSON API requests using the geonames project.

In addition the following projects were also created:

- Adder Subtractor - a basic JavaScript calculator without Angular to prove requisite skills for course.
- Multiplication Table - 
- Open Weather Map
