## Countries and Capitals

An Angular app that allows users to search and visualize data about countries and capital cities. This project will put your new knowledge of routes and services to the test, while forcing you to dive deeper into animation, promises and XHR requests.

The app will have the following screens:

### An introductory screen
This view is just responsible for displaying some explanatory text about the app. 

### List of Countries
A list of all of the countries with the following summary information: 

- name 
- country code
- capital
- area in square kilometres
- population
- continent code.

### Country Details
When you click on a country in the list, you are taken to the country detail view for that country. The following data should be displayed: 

- country name
- population of country
- area
- capital
- population of capital
- continent
- timezone
- number and names of neighbours
- an image of the flag and map for the country
